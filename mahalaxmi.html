<b>Mahalakshmi Temple (also known as Ambabai Mandir) is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi,</b>
<b>who resides here as Supreme Mother Mahalakshmi and is worshipped by locals as Ambabai. Goddess Mahalakshmi is</b>
<b>considered to be Devi Lakshmi the consort of Lord Vishnu by Vaishnavites and to be Devi Parvati the consort of</b> 
<b>Lord Shiva by Shaivas and Shaktas. It is customary among Hindus to visit Tirumala Venkateswara Temple,</b>
