<b>New Palace, Kolhapur is a palace situated in Kolhapur, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The Palace took 7 years to complete,</b>
<b>from 1877 to 1884,[1] costing about seven lakhs of rupees.[2] Being an excellent specimen of Indian architecture built in black </b>
<b>polished stone, it has been an attraction for tourists. It has extensive premises with a garden, fountain and wrestling ground.</b>
<b>The whole building is eight-angled and has a tower in the middle. The clock on it was fixed in 1877. At separate distances there</b>
<b>are small towers. On every glass are painted the events in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's life, the founder of Maratha Empire.</b> 
<b>There is a zoo and a ground lake.</b>
